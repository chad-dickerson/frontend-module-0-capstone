##Solution for checker_board
* This was very difficult for me to figure. I imagine creating a function for getting the users input for size would be a good start as in a prompt for the variable of size. Then create a loop for determining the size of the board. Use if and else statements to tell the program how to draw out the board. I had an incredibly difficult time trying to understand how to do this on my own, however I did find an example online that helped.
I had difficulty with the js as I could not understand how the prompt was going to work. I will need to go over this with my mentor.
