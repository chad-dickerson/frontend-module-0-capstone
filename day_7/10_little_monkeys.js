for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++)
   console.log(numbers[i] + ' little monkeys jumping on the bed, \nOne fell off and bumped his head, \nMama called the doctor and the doctor said,\n"No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"')
   console.log(one + ' little monkey jumping on the bed, \nHe fell off and bumped his head, \nMama called the doctor and the doctor said, \n"Get those monkeys right to bed!"')

//Bonus: Yes as long as I add more values to the numbers array. For my program it would be more time consumptive to do so.
